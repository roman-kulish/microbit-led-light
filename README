# Micro:bit V2 Interactive LED Strip with Motion and Light Sensing

This project showcases how to create an interactive LED strip experience using a Micro:bit V2 board, a PIR motion sensor, a VEML6030 ambient light sensor, and a WS2812B addressable LED strip. 

## Features

* **Multiple Modes:**
    * **Lights ON:** LEDs display a static pattern, controlled by button B.
    * **Motion Activated:** LEDs react to motion detected by the PIR sensor.
    * **Lights OFF:**  All LEDs are turned off.
* **Button Control:**
    * Button A: Cycles through the different modes.
    * Button B: Changes the LED animation pattern (in Lights ON mode).
* **Ambient Light Sensing:** The VEML6030 sensor adjusts the brightness of the LEDs based on the surrounding light levels.
* **WS2812B LED Strip:**  Utilizes the `WS2812FX` library for a variety of captivating LED animation patterns.

## Hardware Requirements

* Micro:bit V2 board
* PIR motion sensor
* VEML6030 ambient light sensor
* WS2812B addressable LED strip (adjust length and power supply as needed)
* Jumper wires
* Breadboard (optional, for prototyping)

## Software Requirements

* Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
* Adafruit_Microbit library 
* SparkFun_VEML6030_Ambient_Light_Sensor library
* WS2812FX library

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Install the required libraries.** 
3. **Connect the hardware components** according to the wiring diagram (provided below or in a separate file).
4. **Open the project** in your Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
5. **Compile and upload** the code to your Micro:bit V2.

## Wiring Diagram

* *Include a clear and well-labeled wiring diagram here or reference a separate file.*

## Code Structure

* **`main.cpp`:**  Main program logic, setup, and loop.
* **`Button.h/.cpp`:**  Button class for debouncing and handling button presses.
* **`State.h/.cpp`:**  State management for modes and LED patterns.
* **`VEML6030.h/.cpp`:**  Handles ambient light sensing and brightness adjustment.
* **`matrix.h`:**  Defines Micro:bit LED matrix patterns for different modes.

## Usage

1. **Power on** your Micro:bit V2.
2. **Press button A** to cycle through the modes.
3. **Press button B** to change the LED animation pattern (in Lights ON mode).
4. The LEDs will automatically adjust their brightness based on the ambient light.
5. In Motion Activated mode, the LEDs will respond to motion detected by the PIR sensor.

## Customization

* Adjust the VEML6030 sensor settings and brightness mapping in `VEML6030.cpp` to fine-tune the light sensitivity.
* Modify the LED animation patterns or add new ones in `State.cpp` and `WS2812FX.h`.
* Experiment with different motion detection thresholds and LED responses in `main.cpp`.
